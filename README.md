# Password Maker

## Description

This project challenge has the goal to create an application that generates a random password based on the criteria the user selects. This app will run in the browser, it involves basic HTML and CSS powered by the JavaScript code that I create for the application to meet the acceptance criteria. 
For the creation of the app I used diverse topics such as: console log, variables, primitive types, logical comparison operators, arrays, iteration, functions, scope and methods. 

With this app, the user has the possibility of chossing what character types he/she wants its password to include and the length of it, with this information, the app will return a secure and strong random password every time. 

## Installation

## Usage

When the user open the browser, then sees a "generate password" button. When the user clicks the button then a window prompt pops up asking for the length of the password, if the user choose a number between 8-128 then the series of confirmations begin, on the contrary, an alert is display saying that the number of characters allow are between 8-128. The series of confirmations are for the user to choose what character types want the password to include such as: Lowercase, Uppercase, Number and/or Special characters (User must choose at least 1 character type). 

After confirming and declaring the password length and all the criteria, the random password is display in the input box, meeting all the criteria the user choose.
